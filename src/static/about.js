       but the word "minder" typically means to be attentive to or take care of something.
       Therefore, "MealMinder" could be interpreted as an application that helps users keep track of their meals
        or reminds them to eat at regular intervals. It could also imply that the application is designed to help
        users be more mindful of their eating habits and make healthier choices.</p>
